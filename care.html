		<h2>Care For a Bearded Dragon</h2>
		<p>Getting the right things for the basic set up of your bearded dragon is important, such as a proper enclosure with proper lighting and making sure you are aware
		of a good diet. But simply having all these things isn't enough, especially if you want your bearded dragon to be happy and safe. So what makes a bearded dragon happy? 
		it's important to always remember that they aren't dogs, but still keep in mind that they need attention and time outside of their enclosure or they will get stressed out,
        or depressed. Bearded dragons love sunlight and exploring their surroundings, so letting them roam around your house or especially outside in nature (while keeping an eye on them)
		is a great way to keep them entertained and happy. Another thing to consider is consistently cleaning their enclosure when it gets dirty to avoid the risk of infection.
		Another way to keep them clean is to soak them in water, not deeper than they can sit up in, for about 15-30 minutes in warm water. Some bearded dragons even like to swim. 
		If you do these things in accordance with proper husbandry and feeding, your bearded dragon is likely to live both a healthy and happy life.</p>

		<p>When you go to move your bearded dragon from place to place or hold them up, it's important to know the correct way to go about this. Picking them up wrong or
		holding them wrong can cause them discomfort or to freak out, which you don't want. When going to lift them up you want to slide your hand under their chest/belly area and 
		gently lift up, then you can slide another hand under the base of the tail. Supporting the base of the tail is super important because doing this will help them feel balanced.
		Never pick a bearded dragon up by the tail, this will not only scare them but hurt them and risk the possibility of injuring their spine.</P>
